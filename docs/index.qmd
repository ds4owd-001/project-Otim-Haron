**Project Description**

1.  I would like to clean up the data on specific excel sheets and validate that it meets the requirements for analysis.
2.  I would like to analyse the data and build models that can be used to provide insights to the WASH related issues.
3.  I would like to visualize the data and report it to the decision makers in charge.
4.  I would like to manage the data, store it well and ensure it's accessibility to stakeholders and researchers.

**Import**

```{r}
library(jmpwashdata)
library(tidyverse)
read_excel(here::here("data/raw/JMP_2023_UGA_Uganda.xlsx"))
```
